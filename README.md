## Introduction

Boske is a DeFi-enabled crypto collectibles web3 learning game developed by *Venten Labs* and *Argand Web3 Innovation for Latam* that allows players to stake Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) avatars with interest-generating aTokens and interact with the Boske metaverse. It is a unique combination of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and NFTs.

Robosepus (or BoskeNFTs) are pixelated ghosts living on the Ethereum blockchain, backed by the ERC-721 standard. Their value is determined by rarity level, which is calculated via multiple factors, such as base traits, amount of staked collateral/aTokens, and equipped wearables.

To level up their Robosepus, players can participate in a variety of activities including mini-games, governance, and meetups. Robosepus can also increase their rarity level by equipping in-game wearables and leveling up.

Rare Robosepus not only have higher secondary marketplace value, they also enable the Robosepu to perform better in rarity farmingâ€”a minigame that rewards the rarest Robosepu with GHST tokens.

Boske is governed by BoskeDAO that manages all funds generated through the LILA token distribution.
