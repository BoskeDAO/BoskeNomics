## 2. Stake LILA, earn LERN
Staking refers to the process of locking up your cryptocurrency in return for rewards. This is no different in the Boske project. The native token, LILA, can be staked in the Staking Contract to earn LERNs.

LERNs are a non-transferable balance within the Boske Staking Contract. LERNs cannot be purchased. They are meant to reward stakers for their contributions to the Boske project.

LERNs can then be converted into Raffle Tickets, which can be entered into periodic Raffles to win prizes.

## 3. Buy raffle tickets with LERN, win a BOSKE NFT.
